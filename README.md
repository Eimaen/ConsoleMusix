# ConsoleMusix
Full-featured console-based media player. The project is under development and is sometimes updated. This app was originally intended for personal use.

## Features
ConsoleMusix currently supports:
* Standard features of a media player (Pause, Play, Stop, Position Changing, etc.)
* Discord RPC
* Musixmatch **Unofficial** lyrics API
* Direct download from Soundcloud / Youtube
* Music waveform visualization
* Perfect console interface *(and supports mouse ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯)*

* Redesign of controls
* Save `.lyrlib` files automatically when lyrics from Musixmatch recieved

I'm glad to see you here. If you have any **ideas** or **suggestions** about the project, open a new issue and describe them.
